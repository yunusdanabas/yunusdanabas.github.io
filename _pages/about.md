I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in Mechatronics and Electronics Engineering at Sabancı University, Turkey, pursuing a double major in Mechatronics and Electronics Engineering. I have consistently maintained a high academic standard and have built a strong foundation in robotics, control systems, and embedded technologies. In addition to my coursework, I have actively contributed to several research projects and internships, which have shaped my practical expertise in system modeling, sensor integration, and real-time simulation.

I work in [Prof. Volkan Patoğlu’s](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=McT4RRAAAAAJ&hl=tr) [the Human Machine Interaction Laboratory lab](https://hmi.sabanciuniv.edu/), where I also serve as his teaching assistant, and I have developed hands-on skills through internships at the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (TUM MIRMI) and TÜBİTAK BİLGEM. My involvement with the Sabancı University Rover Team has further honed my abilities. My research interests lie in advancing robotic systems by integrating data-driven control strategies, wearable robotics, and sensor fusion techniques to address real-world challenges in automation and human-robot interaction.

## Research Interests

- **Robotic Control & Simulation**: Developing and refining data-driven and optimization-based control strategies, with a focus on real-time simulation of complex dynamics using tools like MuJoCo.
- **Wearable Robotics & Sensor Integration**: Exploring how sensor technologies and real-time feedback can improve the performance of assistive and rehabilitation devices.
- **Embedded Systems & Hardware-Software Integration**: Leveraging my hands-on experience with microcontrollers, 3D printing, and CAD design to build robust robotic systems that bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications.
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Investigating how advanced control methods and sensor fusion can enhance interactions between humans and robotic systems in dynamic environments.
