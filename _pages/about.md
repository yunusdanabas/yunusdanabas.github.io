I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Sabancı University in Turkey, pursuing a double major in Mechatronics and Electronics Engineering. I have maintained a high academic standard while building a solid foundation in robotics, control systems, and embedded technologies. Beyond my coursework, I have actively participated in diverse research projects and internships, which have honed my skills in system modeling, sensor integration, and real-time simulation.

Currently, I work in [Prof. Volkan Patoğlu’s](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=McT4RRAAAAAJ&hl=tr) [Human Machine Interaction Laboratory](https://hmi.sabanciuniv.edu/), where I also serve as his teaching assistant. My internships at the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (TUM MIRMI) and TÜBİTAK BİLGEM, along with my work with the Sabancı University Rover Team, have provided me with practical expertise. My research interests focus on advancing robotic systems through data-driven control strategies, wearable robotics, and sensor fusion to solve real-world challenges in automation and human-robot interaction.

## Research Interests

- **Robotic Control & Simulation**: Refining data-driven and optimization-based control strategies, with a focus on real-time simulation of complex dynamics using tools like MuJoCo.  
- **Wearable Robotics & Sensor Integration**: Investigating how sensor technologies and real-time feedback can enhance the performance of assistive and rehabilitation devices.  
- **Embedded Systems & Hardware-Software Integration**: Utilizing my hands-on experience with microcontrollers, 3D printing, and CAD design to develop robust robotic systems that effectively bridge theory and practice.  
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Exploring how advanced control methods and sensor fusion can improve the interaction between humans and robots in dynamic environments.
